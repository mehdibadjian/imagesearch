      "description": "\"<b>Donald Trump</b>\" is a song by American rapper/singer Mac Miller, and the only song released as an official single from his mixtape \"Best Day Ever\". The melody, which is played throughout the song, is taken from \"Vesuvius\" by Sufjan Stevens. The music video to the song was uploaded to YouTube on March 3, 2011, while the single was released digitally on May 17, 2011. \"<b>Donald Trump</b>\" is also incorrectly included as a bonus track on the track list of some versions of Mac Miller's debut album \"Blue Slide Park\". Miller himself confirmed that the song does not feature on the album. The song was dedicated to the American business magnate <b>Donald Trump</b>, who, five years after the song's release, was elected as the 45th President of the United States. During <b>Trump</b>'s 2016 campaign, the song regained popularity, hitting #28 on the iTunes Charts on November 9, 2016, the day after he was elected president. However Mac Miller has personally stated in an interview that he was not a supporter of <b>Trump</b>.",
